== Description ==

Grants theme developers convenient access to Dan Eden's baseline grid overlay service, Basehold.it.

Append **?bl** to a url to get a baseline with default color and height. Use **bl=INT** and **col=HEX** parameters to adjust grid options on the fly, or adjust the defaults as needed via the plugin settings page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

I've appended ?bl to my page url but I can't see the grid overlay?

The default grid colour is **white**. So, if you have a mostly white website, you might struggle to see it unless you change the colour using one of the methods described above.
